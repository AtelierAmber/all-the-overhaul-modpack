# Before you start with your existing game
Please follow these steps to get the full K2 and SE migrations from 1.1 to 2.0: 

1. Just in case: create a backup of your old save outside of your Factorio folders.
2. If you don't have a copy of Factorio 1.1 anymore, download the standalone version [here](https://factorio.com/download/archive/1.1.110) and put it somewhere separate from your Factorio 2.0 installation.
3. Make sure all mods are up to date and load your save in Factorio 1.1 and save it again.
4. Copy the save to Factorio 2.0 and sync mods and settings with the save. Install new dependencies and omit those that don't exist for 2.0.
5. Install alternatives for any missing mod (if existing). Many mods are released under new names ("updated", "legacy", etc.).
6. Compare all mod settings to 1.1. Mods that are released under a new name won't get the settings synced from your save.
7. Load your save with the new mod selection. The migration will take several minutes (5-10 minutes is totally normal).
