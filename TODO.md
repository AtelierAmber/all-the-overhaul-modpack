# TODO list
## High priority

  - ~~Idea: Just add dust. The rest stays normal.~~
  - ~~Remove enriched/pure zircon~~ I incorperated the enriched into the final phase of the zirconium processing
- ~~Balance dirty water treatment (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1215242462881390634)~~
- ~~Remove empty technologies (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1215242462881390634)~~

- ~~Remove molten to ingot recipes (they have no use and the icons are broken)~~

## Low priority
- Check compatibility with "Realistic fusion power" (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1213528601996304455)
- Check compatibility with 5Dim's mining (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1214273973664219187)
- Have a look at alloying (mix in other metals to reduce the amount needed of the main metal)
- 5Dim's labs are probably not a good addition (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1192685170210385961)
- Revisit QoL/smaller mods that are currently a mandatory dependency for ATOM (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1215765362533204019)
- Sort icons for recipes and items
- Tweak colors of lead
  - Ingot has the wrong color
  - Overall the colors don't remind of the old lead look and don't fit the ore color
- Properly integrate Bio industries
  - The wood recipes are far worse than the K2 ones. There is no reason to use them.
- Improve turret balance
  - Big turrets are OP
  - Small turrets are useless
  - Maybe add a different mod for warfare?
- The early biomatter recipe uses ingredients that are unavailable when the recipe is unlocked.
  - In addition, it should be less extreme as it currently is.
- The additional repair packs are useless because they have no additional durability
- Add a replacement for tungsten-carbide-casting to the new processing
