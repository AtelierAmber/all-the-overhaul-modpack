## Low priority

- Check compatibility with "Realistic fusion
  power" (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1213528601996304455)
- Check compatibility with 5Dim's mining (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1214273973664219187)
- Have a look at alloying (mix in other metals to reduce the amount needed of the main metal)
- 5Dim's labs are probably not a good addition (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1192685170210385961)
- Revisit QoL/smaller mods that are currently a mandatory dependency for
  ATOM (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1215765362533204019)
- Tweak colors of lead
    - Ingot has the wrong color
    - Overall the colors don't remind of the old lead look and don't fit the ore color
- Properly integrate Bio industries
    - The wood recipes are far worse than the K2 ones. There is no reason to use them.
- Improve turret balance
    - Big turrets are OP
    - Small turrets are useless
    - Maybe add a different mod for warfare?
- The early biomatter recipe uses ingredients that are unavailable when the recipe is unlocked.
    - In addition, it should be less extreme as it currently is.
- The additional repair packs are useless because they have no additional durability
- Add a replacement for tungsten-carbide-casting to the new processing
- Balance 5Dim's Pumpjacks (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1214273973664219187)
