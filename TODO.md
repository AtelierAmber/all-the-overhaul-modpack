## Low priority
- Check compatibility with "Realistic fusion power" (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1213528601996304455)
- Check compatibility with 5Dim's mining (https://discord.com/channels/1174743568590590053/1214273973664219187)
- Have a look at alloying (mix in other metals to reduce the amount needed of the main metal)
